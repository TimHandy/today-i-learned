      <h1>Today I Learned</h1>
    <p>
      This is a simple React app, using functional stateless dumb components and smart class-based components with state.
    </p>
    <p>
      The App pulls data from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd74V7F_lA8MH3StsQXPki8xUSYRWb_msG6pB3ejNdnUFzPqg/viewform" target="_blank">Today I Learned</a> Google form which saves data to a spreadsheet.
      The data is retrieved via a fetch command, pushed into state, and the child components are rendered via the state being passed in to the children as props. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The data is displayed in reverse date order, newest at the top.
